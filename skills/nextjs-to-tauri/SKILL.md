# Next.js 16 → Tauri 2 Desktop App

## Overview

Wrap a **client-side** Next.js 16 (App Router) app in a thin Tauri 2 native shell. Preserve web behavior while adding the export configuration and desktop integrations needed. Tauri serves the export from its embedded asset server. GitHub Actions can build the native shell when a local Rust toolchain is unavailable.

**Core principle:** Tauri loads the static export over its own asset protocol — which behaves differently from a real HTTP server. Most migration pain is path/routing resolution, not React.

## When to use

- The app is (or can be) a **static export** (`output: "export"`) — diffing/formatting/calculator/viewer tools, no SSR-at-runtime needed.
- You want a desktop/portable `.exe`, `.dmg`, `.AppImage`, optionally with auto-update.

A live Node server, runtime API routes, SSR or server actions require a different packaging design, such as a separately assessed sidecar. This playbook covers Next.js static exports.

## Project changes

Adapt templates into the target project: Next config and package scripts, `src-tauri/`, selected desktop frontend code, icons, ignore rules and the build workflow. Preserve unrelated web behavior. Migration authorization covers these necessary local changes; do not add a separate approval before every file write. Signing-service configuration and publication follow the user's authorized scope.

## Procedure

Adapt these steps to the repository. Supporting files contain the configuration and code templates.

**Package manager:** the commands and `desktop-build.yml` assume Yarn Classic. In an npm or pnpm repo substitute the equivalent (`npm ci` / `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `npx tauri` / `pnpm tauri`) and change the workflow's `cache:` and install line — `cache: yarn` fails outright when there is no `yarn.lock`.

1. **Verify target-compatible stable versions** (this playbook targets Tauri 2):
   - npm: query the published 2.x versions of `@tauri-apps/cli` and the plugins used, then confirm JS/Rust compatibility. An upstream `latest` in a higher major does not change this playbook's target.
   - crates: read and parse the package metadata as JSON, for example:
     ```bash
     # Save metadata, then parse it as data.
     curl -sA x -o crates-tauri.json https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/tauri
     node -p "JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('crates-tauri.json','utf8')).crate.max_stable_version"
     ```
     `max_stable_version` is an upstream reference, not the install target when it is outside 2.x. Select published, non-yanked stable 2.x releases for core and each required plugin (`tauri-plugin-opener`, `tauri-plugin-updater`, …), and verify their compatibility.
   - actions: `gh api repos/actions/checkout/releases/latest --jq .tag_name` (+ `actions/setup-node`, `Swatinem/rust-cache`, `actions/upload-artifact`; `tauri-apps/tauri-action@v1` is the moving major tag — check its README, not the release list)
   - node: current Active LTS from the [official schedule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nodejs/Release/main/schedule.json). Pin that major in `desktop-build.yml`; **do not use `lts/*` or `latest`** — CI would jump to a new line without a reviewed upgrade.
   - `engines.node` is the code's real floor (take it from Next.js/Tauri CLI constraints), not a copy of the CI major; `.nvmrc` is optional.
   - optional: when `desktop-app-standard` is available, its audit can supplement version and CI checks. The migration does not depend on installing another skill.

2. **Gate static export on Tauri** in `next.config.*`, using the explicit `TAURI_BUILD` flag shown below (gotcha #1). Existing reliable build gating can be retained. Merge into your existing config, keeping the `next-intl` plugin wrapper:
   ```ts
   // The NextConfig annotation is load-bearing: spreading `{ output: "export" }` into an
   // un-annotated object literal widens output to `string`, and withNextIntl() then
   // rejects it — `yarn build:tauri` fails type-checking before it ever builds.
   import type { NextConfig } from "next";
   import createNextIntlPlugin from "next-intl/plugin";
   const withNextIntl = createNextIntlPlugin();

   const isDev = process.env.NODE_ENV === "development";
   const isTauri = process.env.TAURI_BUILD === "1"; // set by `yarn build:tauri`

   const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
     // ...your existing config...
     ...(isDev ? {} : { output: "export" }),       // export is build-only (gotcha #2)
     ...(isTauri ? { trailingSlash: true } : {}),   // Tauri-only (gotcha #1)
     images: { unoptimized: true },
   };

   export default withNextIntl(nextConfig);  // keep your existing wrapper(s)
   ```
   Add the flag-setting script (`yarn add -D cross-env`) — tauri.conf's `beforeBuildCommand` runs it, NOT plain `yarn build`:
   ```jsonc
   // package.json → "scripts"
   "build:tauri": "cross-env TAURI_BUILD=1 next build"
   ```

3. **Scaffold** (CLI steps are JS — no Rust needed):
   ```bash
   yarn add -D @tauri-apps/cli@^2
   yarn tauri init --ci --app-name "<app>" --window-title "<Title>" \
     --frontend-dist "../out" --dev-url "http://localhost:3000" \
     --before-dev-command "yarn dev" --before-build-command "yarn build:tauri"
   # The source must be SQUARE (the CLI says "squared PNG or SVG") and 1024x1024 — that
   # is the master Tauri's icon generator works from, so a smaller source gets scaled up.
   yarn tauri icon public/logo.png
   ```
   Mobile icon directories need no cleanup for this migration. Retain them if the project has mobile targets.

   Then **fix `.gitignore`** — see gotcha #3.

4. **Edit `src-tauri/` config & Rust.** Adapt `tauri-files.md`, including its CSP and optional-updater checklist: `tauri.conf.json` (window `url`, updater, `webviewInstallMode`, portable `mainBinaryName`), `Cargo.toml` (plugin deps + release profile), `src/lib.rs` (plugin registration + tray + single-instance), `capabilities/default.json` (permissions).

5. **Frontend integration** (only the features you need). Adapt `frontend-integration.md` to the project's existing desktop boundary (the examples use `src/app/desktop/`): external-links util (opener-based), auto-update hook, and — for `next-intl` apps — the language-choice hook (it remembers the locale the **user** picked in the switcher). Mount them in one `"use client"` component rendered inside your providers (e.g. antd `<App>`, inside `NextIntlClientProvider`). That component also installs the global external-link interceptor (gotcha #10). Switch locales with plain `router.push` (soft nav works in Tauri — never hard-nav a switch); if you remember the language, guard the launch redirect with a module-level flag (gotcha #11).
   The supplied updater downloads in the background before asking to install; include it only when that matches the product's update policy. Timing and network behavior are documented in `frontend-integration.md`.

6. **Version single-source + CI.** Add `src-tauri/update-version.cjs` and an `update-version` script (copies `package.json` version into `tauri.conf.json`). Copy `desktop-build.yml` for cross-platform builds, signing, draft release with `latest.json`, and the portable-exe steps. Copy [release-assets.mjs](release-assets.mjs) into the app at `.github/scripts/release-assets.mjs`. The verifier compares the exact draft files and digests with per-target evidence from this workflow run before generating checksums and attestation.
   The helper copies the project package version into Tauri config; review the resulting project diff with the migration changes.

   - **Make the git tag the single source of truth (the template does this):** on tag push, `npm pkg set version="${GITHUB_REF_NAME#v}"` (guarded `if: github.event_name == 'push'`) runs *before* `update-version`, so installer filenames, the embedded app version and `tagName: v__VERSION__` all equal the tag — you set the version by tagging, never by bumping branches. Do NOT point `tagName` at `github.ref_name` (gotcha #13).
   - **If you skip injection, the pushed git tag MUST equal `package.json` version** (`v3.0.0` ↔ `"version": "3.0.0"`). `tauri-action` expands `__VERSION__` from the app version, and the portable-exe step uploads to `v${APP_VERSION}` — a mismatch silently breaks the portable upload.
   - **Verify signing by platform.** Updater signatures and OS code signing are separate. Configure the required Windows/macOS signing and notarization for the actual distribution, and report unsigned or unverified paths rather than assuming the template covers them.

7. **Auto-update signing keys** (only if shipping updates):
   ```bash
   yarn tauri signer generate --ci -p "" -w src-tauri/app.key   # private key — gitignore it, NEVER commit (gotcha #7)
   cat src-tauri/app.key.pub   # paste this base64 into tauri.conf.json plugins.updater.pubkey
   ```
   > **Signing secrets the release workflow needs:** the private key has to be stored as a
   > repository secret named `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` (plus
   > `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` when the key has a password). Without them the CI
   > signing step fails and **no updater artifacts are produced**. The private key file
   > itself must never be committed.
   >
   > Do **not** add `-f` to `signer generate`: it force-overwrites an existing key file,
   > which would invalidate the key already published in `plugins.updater.pubkey`.
   >
   > Set the secrets when credentials and authorization are available; otherwise hand off the exact missing setup:
   ```bash
   gh secret set TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY < src-tauri/app.key   # bash / Git Bash
   # only if you generated the key WITH a password (not `-p ""`):
   gh secret set TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD
   ```
   **PowerShell** has no `<` redirection — pipe instead:
   ```powershell
   Get-Content src-tauri/app.key -Raw | gh secret set TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY
   ```
   Manual path: repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret.

8. **Verify the frontend export:** `yarn build:tauri`, then confirm the export shape:
   ```bash
   ls "out/<default-locale>/index.html"   # use the configured locale; single-locale apps use out/index.html
   ```
   If Rust and platform dependencies are available, build and exercise the shell locally. Otherwise use CI and report which native checks remain unverified.

## Delivery and remaining setup

Report the generated package and checks actually performed. Hand off only unfinished actions, such as missing signing credentials, target-device checks or publication outside the authorized scope. The supplied workflow creates a verified draft; `releases/latest` ignores drafts, so the release must be published before clients can discover it. A tag must include the applicable workflow and select the intended source commit.

## Gotchas (the non-obvious, hard-won ones)

| # | Gotcha | Fix |
|---|--------|-----|
| 1 | **White screen / flat files.** The asset server may not resolve an extensionless path to `en.html`. | For this directory-index template, use `trailingSlash: true` in the desktop export and enter the configured locale directory, e.g. `/en/`. Keep the window URL and frontend default locale consistent. `TAURI_BUILD` makes the build choice explicit; retain another verified configuration when appropriate. |
| 2 | **`output: "export"` and middleware do not fit together in Next 16.** Next's static-export docs put **Proxy** (Next 16's name for middleware) and Internationalized Routing under *unsupported features*, so next-intl's locale-detection proxy cannot run in an exported build. next-intl's own static-export page still pairs `withNextIntl({ output: "export" })` with a `proxy.ts`, which is why the trap is easy to fall into. | Make `output` build-only (`isDev ? {} : {...}`) so dev keeps redirecting and only the export drops the proxy. |
| 3 | **`src-tauri/` vanishes from `git status`.** Some repo `.gitignore`s have a bare `src-tauri` line. | Replace with `src-tauri/target` + `src-tauri/gen/schemas`. Verify: `git check-ignore src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` returns nothing. |
| 4 | **`isTauri()` false positives** if you detect by dynamic-importing `@tauri-apps/api`. It imports fine in a plain browser; `invoke` only throws at call time. | Detect via runtime globals: `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__` / `__TAURI__` / UA contains `Tauri`. Same bundle ships to web + desktop. |
| 5 | **Single-instance plugin must be registered FIRST**, before all other plugins, or second-launch refocus won't route. Desktop-only (target-gate it off mobile). | See `lib.rs` ordering in `tauri-files.md`. |
| 6 | **CI succeeds but clients see no update.** Stable `releases/latest` ignores draft and prerelease releases. | Check the actual endpoint and publication state. The supplied workflow verifies a draft before publication; do not delete a published release to make a draft-only rerun work. Use a new version for published corrections, or adapt to the repository's existing publication policy. |
| 7 | **Committing the private signing key** lets anyone sign malicious auto-updates your clients auto-trust. The `.pub` is public/safe; the bare key is not. | `.gitignore` the private key; store it only as a GitHub secret. If one ever lands in git history, rotate it. |
| 8 | **Portable "green" exe + auto-update are incompatible.** `update.install()` expects an installed-app layout; on a standalone exe it fails/no-ops. The portable exe also needs the **WebView2** runtime (preinstalled Win 11 / current Win 10; absent on old LTSC/Server). | It's the raw `target/release/<mainBinaryName>.exe` (web assets compiled in). Ship it for convenience, but document "no self-update" and the WebView2 dependency. `install()` **rejects** here, so the hook's `onOk` must await it inside a `try/catch` and say so in the UI — without that the user confirms an install and nothing visibly happens. You can't cleanly detect "am I portable?" at runtime — it's the *same* compiled binary as the one inside the installers — so to truly hide the update prompt you'd produce a separate build with the updater plugin disabled. |
| 9 | **System-language detection returns the wrong or unsupported locale.** | Preserve the product's language policy. The example starts at the configured default and remembers an explicit choice. If auto-detection is wanted, validate against supported locales with a fallback and never overwrite an existing user preference. |
| 10 | **External links replace the app page or opener calls are denied.** | Route intended external URLs through plugin-opener and keep internal links with the router. Grant the needed URL scopes: `opener:default` covers common schemes, or use explicit scoped permissions. A bare command permission without matching scope is insufficient. |
| 11 | **Locale switching bounces back.** Startup redirects or hard reloads run again after the locale layout remounts. | Prefer soft router navigation. Keep the startup guard stable across remounts (the example uses a module variable), and persist explicit choices after startup restoration so the entry locale cannot overwrite a saved preference. |
| 12 | **Linux aborts with EGL errors or an AppImage opens blank.** | Distinguish WebKit DMABUF failure from bundled Wayland/host library incompatibility before applying workarounds; see [Linux diagnosis](tauri-files.md#linux-egl-与-appimage-兼容性). |
| 13 | **A CI fix on `main` doesn't apply to the release; or the release comes out empty / with mismatched installers.** Tag-triggered runs execute the workflow definition **from the tagged commit**, not the branch tip — tag a commit whose history predates your fix and the *old* workflow runs (or a newly-added `push: tags` trigger never fires at all). Separately, pointing `tagName` at `github.ref_name` ships a release *named* `v3.0.1` containing `..._3.0.0_...` installers, because installer names + embedded version come from `tauri.conf.json`, not `tagName` (and on `workflow_dispatch`, `github.ref_name` is a branch name). | Cut the `v*` tag from a commit that already contains the corrected workflow. A published release is repaired with a new tag containing the fix. An unpublished draft can be rebuilt from its original source commit; stale assets must be reviewed before rerunning draft verification. For version coherence, inject the tag into `package.json` at build time (step 6), don't fiddle with `tagName`. **Multi-app "release hub"** (one tag on `main` fans out to Tauri + Electron, each workflow reading its full source SHA from a source map committed in that tag): keep the source map and workflows in the release tag commit. Every commit that may receive a triggering tag must carry its applicable workflow. |

## Validation boundary

Confirm the static export locally and verify native startup, tray, locale persistence and updater behavior on the supported platforms. A frontend build or CI compile alone does not prove desktop behavior. Package sizes come from the generated assets, not a fixed estimate.
