# MD Web

> Turn any content into a web page with a shareable URL. Uploads Markdown to an S3-compatible storage bucket, rendered by Docsify.

[中文文档](README.zh.md)

## Installation

Pick whichever matches your agent / CLI:

```bash
# ClawHub / OpenClaw
clawhub install md-web

# skills.sh (Vercel skills CLI — Claude Code, Cursor, and more)
npx skills@1.7.2 add rockbenben/aishort-skills
```

Pin the CLI version as shown. An unpinned `npx skills add …` resolves whatever the
registry serves at install time, so the installer you review is not the installer that
runs.

That pins the **installer**, not the **content**. The fetched skill is still whatever the
repository serves at install time; what pins the content is the skill's own released
version, so install a release you have read and re-run the install after an upgrade —
the version is in `skills/md-web/SKILL.md`. Reviewing the installer does not review the
skill: read the skill before you install it.

Or install manually — clone this repo and copy (or symlink) the `skills/md-web/` folder
into the skills directory your agent reads from. A single folder named `md-web` is all
it needs; use whichever path your agent documents.

## Quick Start

1. Install the skill (see above)
2. On first use, the AI will guide you through bucket configuration
3. The AI then provisions the viewer once — a separate step that writes the page shell
   and its assets to your bucket, and again after any upgrade of the skill. It asks
   you first, because that step rewrites shared state at the bucket root.
4. After that, tell the AI "share as a link" whenever you want to publish content as a web page

## What this touches

The complete list of what this skill does. Nothing outside it happens.

- **Publishing one document** writes **exactly one object** — `md-web/<timestamp>-<slug>-<suffix>.md`
  — under the `md-web/` prefix of your bucket. It writes nothing else and deletes nothing.
- **Provisioning the viewer** (`--setup`) is a **separate command**, never a side effect of
  publishing. It **overwrites the viewer files at the bucket root** (`index.html`,
  `README.md`, `assets/`) — shared state that every published link depends on.
- **`expire_days`** is the only bucket administration, and it is **off unless you set it**.
  With it set, the setup step **reads** your bucket's lifecycle configuration and writes
  back **one rule of its own**, scoped to the `md-web/` prefix; `0` removes that rule
  again. Every other rule and every bucket-wide setting is preserved, and the uploads
  under that prefix are **auto-deleted after N days**.
- **Local files:** it reads `~/.md-web/config.json` (your credentials and bucket settings)
  and writes `~/.md-web/.deployed` (a deploy fingerprint).
- **Nothing else.** No other bucket, no other key prefix, no other skill's files, no
  startup entry, no scheduled job, no background service, no third-party service, no
  telemetry.

Scope in one line: it runs `node` locally, reads `~/.md-web/config.json` (or
`MD_WEB_ACCESS_KEY` / `MD_WEB_SECRET_KEY`), makes HTTPS requests **only** to the S3
endpoint you configured, writes the uploaded `.md` plus the viewer assets, may write one
lifecycle rule scoped to the `md-web/` prefix, creates and deletes at most one temporary
file, touches no other skill, and installs nothing.

Every state-changing step — publishing an object, provisioning the viewer, adding or
changing `expire_days` — needs your go-ahead first; the AI asks before each one.

## Bucket Setup

This skill requires an **S3-compatible object storage bucket** with public access enabled. The example below uses Cloudflare R2.

### Step 1: Create a Bucket

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
2. Select **R2 Object Storage** from the left menu
3. Click **Create bucket**, enter a name (e.g., `md-web`), use the default region
4. After creation, go to the bucket's **Settings** page
5. Find **Public Access**, click **Allow Access**, enable the **R2.dev subdomain**
6. Once enabled, a public URL will appear: `https://pub-XXXX.r2.dev`
   → This is the **public_url** in the config

### Step 2: Create an API Token

1. On the R2 page, click **Manage R2 API Tokens**
2. Click **Create API Token**
3. Set permissions to **Object Read & Write** (or **Admin Read & Write** only if you set `expire_days`, which manages a bucket lifecycle rule — see below)
4. Optionally restrict scope to the specific bucket
5. After creation, you'll see:
   - **Access Key ID** → **access_key** in the config
   - **Secret Access Key** → **secret_key** in the config
   - **S3 Endpoint** in the format `https://ACCOUNT_ID.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`
     → Remove `https://`, the rest is the **endpoint**

### Step 3: Tell the AI

On first use, the AI will ask for these fields:

| Field       | Required | Description                                                               | Example                               |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| access_key  | Yes      | API access key ID                                                         | `a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4`    |
| secret_key  | Yes      | API secret access key                                                     | `a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6...` |
| endpoint    | Yes      | S3 endpoint (without `https://`)                                          | `ACCOUNT_ID.r2.cloudflarestorage.com` |
| bucket      | Yes      | Bucket name                                                               | `md-web`                              |
| public_url  | Yes      | Public access URL (custom domain recommended)                             | `https://pub-XXXX.r2.dev`             |
| region      | No       | S3 region (`auto` for R2, actual region for AWS S3, e.g., `us-east-1`)   | `auto`                                |
| expire_days | No       | Auto-delete uploaded files after N days. Unset = this skill never touches the bucket's lifecycle (default) | `30` |

> **Tip**: R2.dev URLs have rate limits. For production use, bind a custom domain to your bucket and use that as `public_url`.

The AI will automatically save these to `~/.md-web/config.json`. No repeat setup needed.

Prefer not to keep a long-lived secret in a file? Leave `access_key` and `secret_key` out
of the config and set `MD_WEB_ACCESS_KEY` / `MD_WEB_SECRET_KEY` in the environment
instead. The config file wins when both are set, so an existing setup keeps working.

## Usage

Uploaded content is **publicly accessible** via the generated URL. The skill only runs when you explicitly ask for it, and the AI tells you the link is public before it uploads anything:

```text
show as a web page
publish this online
/md-web path/to/file.md
share as a link
```

The AI returns a link — click to view the rendered document in your browser.

> **Note**: Markdown image references (e.g., `![](image.png)`) are not uploaded — only the `.md` file itself. Use absolute image URLs if your document includes images.

## Auto-expiry (`expire_days`)

Left unset, this skill never sends a bucket-level request — an **Object Read & Write**
token is all you need, and your bucket's lifecycle configuration is untouched.

Set a number of days and the skill maintains exactly one rule, scoped to the `md-web/`
key prefix; set `0` and it removes that rule again. Either way the viewer files at the
bucket root and any unrelated object are never touched, and **rules you set yourself are
preserved**: the script reads the bucket's lifecycle configuration, drops only its own
rule, and writes the rest back unchanged.

Managing it needs an **Admin Read & Write** token. With a narrower token the setup
step still succeeds and a warning goes by in the output — set the rule in the dashboard
instead. Re-run the one-time setup step after changing it.

## Security

- **Anything you upload is publicly accessible** at the returned URL, and there is no un-publish step (unless `expire_days` is set, which auto-deletes the uploaded file after N days) — never upload secrets, API keys, PII, or other sensitive content.
- Credentials live in **plaintext** in `~/.md-web/config.json`, or in `MD_WEB_ACCESS_KEY` / `MD_WEB_SECRET_KEY` if you prefer to keep them out of a file. On macOS and Linux the script tightens the config file to owner-only access; protect it either way — don't commit it or share it.
- **No elevated privileges.** That owner-only tightening is the only permission change the skill makes: a user-scoped change to a file in your own home directory, made by the script running as you. It never asks for root, never runs an elevated command, and touches no file outside your home directory and the bucket you configured.
- **Use a dedicated bucket.** Uploads and any expiry rule are namespaced under `md-web/`, but a dedicated bucket keeps this skill's bucket-administration rights away from anything you actually care about.
- **The viewer runs your Markdown as HTML on the page.** GFM, tables, `<details>` and inline HTML all render. Two things keep that in bounds: a route guard that only loads same-origin paths under `md-web/` (a crafted link cannot make the viewer fetch a document from another origin), and a Content-Security-Policy without `'unsafe-inline'`, so HTML inside a document cannot run script. What the policy does **not** stop is a document *inserting elements* into the page — so never publish Markdown that came from an untrusted source, and never let a document carry markup you did not write yourself. Readers should treat the page as public and untrusted: anyone who can write to the bucket can put content there.
- **Language is yours.** This skill imposes no language requirement on the document you upload — publish it in the language its content is written in. The English README and the Chinese one (`README.zh.md`) describe the same skill; pick whichever you prefer, neither is required. The viewer's own chrome is English (`MD Web`, `Search`, `No results found`); the word counter follows the uploaded document's own content. Nothing here translates, rewrites or checks the language of what you upload.

## File Structure

```yaml
md-web/                     # Skill directory (managed by ClawHub, may be replaced on upgrade)
├── SKILL.md              # AI instruction file
├── upload.js             # Upload script (pure Node.js, zero dependencies)
├── README.md             # This document
├── README.zh.md          # Chinese documentation
└── docsify-server/       # Viewer files (uploaded by the one-time setup step)
    ├── index.html
    ├── README.md
    └── assets/           # JS/CSS assets (bundled locally, no CDN dependency)

        ├── docsify.min.js
        ├── vue.css
        └── ...

~/.md-web/                  # User data directory (preserved across upgrades)
├── config.json           # Bucket credentials & settings (created on first use)
└── .deployed             # Deploy fingerprint (tracks server deployment state)
```

`upload.js` fingerprints the files in `docsify-server/` (dot-files are ignored and never uploaded) and stores the result in `~/.md-web/.deployed`. When the bundled viewer changes after an upgrade, publishing stops with `SETUP_REQUIRED` until the setup step is run once more.

## Other S3-Compatible Services

Besides Cloudflare R2, this skill works with any S3-compatible object storage:

- **AWS S3**: endpoint is `s3.REGION.amazonaws.com`
- **Backblaze B2**: endpoint is `s3.REGION.backblazeb2.com`
- **DigitalOcean Spaces**: endpoint is `REGION.digitaloceanspaces.com`
- **Wasabi**: endpoint is `s3.REGION.wasabisys.com`
- **Tencent Cloud COS**: endpoint is `cos.REGION.myqcloud.com`

Any service that provides an S3-compatible API and a public access URL will work.
